To create own widget class start class Name with UpperCase: -
    Ex - 
    class GradientContainer extends StatelessWidget{ //own widget class
  Widget build(){//function
  }
}
Build method must return a widget.
@override notation shows that in the end we are going to override a method of a widget.
variable are created with 'var' keyword.
"const" helps dart optimize runtime performance, Once your code executes the things that are created by your code, the widgets, for example,will be stored in the device memory,but with const when you then use that same widget,that same widget with the same text, a second time in the app that existing memory thing will be reused instead of a second memory object being created.
this is a keyword that's used inside of classes, to refer to the class itself or to refer to the object that will be built based on the class.
